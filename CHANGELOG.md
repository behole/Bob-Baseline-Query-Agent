# Changelog

## 2025-10-06 - Enhanced Automation Update

### üéâ New Features

#### 1. Automatic Worksheet Creation
- **Each run now creates a new worksheet (tab)** in your Google Sheets document
- Auto-naming with timestamps (e.g., "Run_2025-10-06_14-30")
- Custom run names supported: `tracker.run_batch(queries, run_name="Weekly_Baseline")`
- Formatted headers with gray background
- Makes week-over-week tracking much easier!

#### 2. Fully Automated Column Population
All previously manual review columns are now auto-populated:

**Column F - Mention Context**
- Automatically categorizes: "Top recommendation", "Listed among options", "Brief mention", "In comparison", "Not mentioned"
- Uses phrase detection to determine how BOB is positioned

**Column G - Position Detection**
- Shows where BOB appears: "Early (sentence 2/10)", "Middle (sentence 5/10)", "Late (sentence 8/10)"
- Detects list positions: "Position #3 in list"
- Handles both narrative and list-based responses

**Column J - Accuracy Verification**
- Verifies BOB product information against known facts
- Categories: "Accurate", "Partially accurate", "Review needed", "No details provided"
- Checks: powder type, SPF levels, brush application, skin types

**Column L - Automated Notes**
- Sentiment analysis (positive/mixed/negative)
- Competitor count tracking
- Feature mentions (reapplication, portability, travel)
- Special cases (powder sunscreen discussed without BOB mention)

### üîß Technical Improvements

- Added 4 new analysis methods: `_analyze_mention_context()`, `_detect_bob_position()`, `_verify_bob_accuracy()`, `_generate_notes()`
- Enhanced `analyze_response()` to return comprehensive analysis dictionary
- Updated `run_batch()` to accept optional `run_name` parameter
- Updated `run_query()` to support worksheet creation for standalone queries
- Added `create_new_worksheet()` method with automatic header formatting
